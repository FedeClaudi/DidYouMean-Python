DidYouMean-Python
=================

Decorator to have variables/functions name suggestions in case of errors (NameError, AttributeError, etc).

Inspired by "Did you mean" for Ruby ([Explanation](http://www.yukinishijima.net/2014/10/21/did-you-mean-experience-in-ruby.html) [Github Page](https://github.com/yuki24/did_you_mean)), this is a simple implementation for/in Python.

See also : [PEP 473 :  Adding structured data to built-in exceptions](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0473/).


Status : just messing around at the moment. Feel free to comment, ask, contribute.
